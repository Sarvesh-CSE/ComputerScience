UNION and UNION ALL are SQL operators used to concatenate 2 or more result sets. This allows us to write multiple SELECT statements, retrieve the desired results, then combine them together into a final, unified set.

The main difference between UNION and UNION ALL is that:

UNION: only keeps unique records
UNION ALL: keeps all records, including duplicates
